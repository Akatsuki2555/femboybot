# Akabot Versioning System

## Versioning Scheme

`<major>.<feature>.<fix>`

### Major

This is reserved for only huge updates. The latest being the MongoDB migration of the bot after SQLite was proven to
be slow for production.

### Feature

This gets bumped when there's a new bot feature or a significant change to an existing feature. This is the most common
bump.

### Fix

This is reserved for small bug fixes or minor changes that don't really add a new feature.
