# Akabot 4.0

- **New Database**: This is the main thing; the database. We have moved to MongoDB from sqlite, improving performance,
  scalability and stability.
- **Better Temporary VC's**: Temporary VC's now have a message that allows you to configure a few of the primary things
  directly.
- **Donations**: We now accept donations using GitHub Sponsors. A sponsor button was added to the GitHub page, along
  with the other ways to donate.
- **Fixes**: All modules are fixed now and tested for functionality. Error reporting was fixed as well and improved to
  be checked per command.
- **Network speed improvements**: Any modules using the internet to retrieve data are now faster.
